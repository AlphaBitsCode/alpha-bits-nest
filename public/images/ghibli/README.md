# Ghibli-Inspired Images

These images are placeholders for the Studio Ghibli-inspired theme. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Create or commission custom artwork in the Ghibli style
2. Ensure proper licensing for any visual assets
3. Optimize images for web performance

The current placeholders are meant to represent:
- dreamy-bg.jpg: A soft, painterly background with pastel colors
- dreamy-clouds.png: Fluffy, whimsical cloud illustrations
- clouds.png: Translucent cloud patterns for parallax effects
- brush-border.png: Watercolor-style brush stroke border textures

For the full Ghibli-inspired experience, these placeholder descriptions should be replaced with actual artwork following the Studio Ghibli aesthetic.
