## Development Philosophy

- Lovable.dev (Start Tier) serves as our integrated development platform, combining project management, development, DevOps, design, and business analysis capabilities.
- Supabase serves as our BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) solution, for cloud-based database management and authentication services, on free Tier.
- Trae AI (https://www.trae.ai/) functions as our intelligent development assistant, handling code optimization, refactoring, syntax refinement, and small-scope content improvements.
- Lovable.dev provides an almost realtime Prompt-to-Production within minutes. We literally imagine what we need, ask for it, and then go fetch a cup of coffee, comeback to see magical changes on Production. Time-saving is insane.
- Human is the ultimate Konductor, giving strategic direction and quality control throughout the development lifecycle.
- I think we will need a lot of AI Translator to translate human ideas into prompts and enventually build any kind of software we need for business to function, tailored to your exact needs, in all aspects. And fully compliance with the legal and ethical standards.
